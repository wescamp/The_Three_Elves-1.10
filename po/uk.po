"As <b>Archer</b> he excels in ranged attacks. He is unmatched in the "

"conceal himself in the woods.\n"

"The <b>Fighter</b> endures most of the melee combats and disposes of "

"\n"
"<b>Hunters</b> are a very versatile unit, very useful at nightime, but weak "
"during day. His power will grow rapidly with time.\n"
"\n"
"The <b>Scout</b> is great at exploring and quick diversions on the "
"battlefield but misses the attack force. It is NOT a very wise choice for "
