"I can become a dexterous archer, a sturdy fighter, balanced hunter or a quick scout. Everything is in your hands, now. These tips may help you:\n"
"\n"
"As <b>Archer</b> he excels in ranged attacks. He is unmatched in the forests, but he's also very vulnerable out of them. He may also learn how to conceal himself in the woods.\n"
"\n"
"The <b>Fighter</b> endures most of the melee combats and disposes of remarkable defense. He may also learn the leadership ability in time.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Hunters</b> are a very versatile unit, very useful at nightime, but weak during day. His power will grow rapidly with time.\n"
"\n"
"The <b>Scout</b> is great at exploring and quick diversions on the battlefield but misses the attack force. It is NOT a very wise choice for this campaign."
