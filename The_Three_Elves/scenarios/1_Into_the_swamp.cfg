I can become a dexterous archer, a sturdy fighter, balanced hunter or a quick scout. Everything is in your hands, now. These tips may help you:

As <b>Archer</b> he excels in ranged attacks. He is unmatched in the forests, but he's also very vulnerable out of them. He may also learn how to conceal himself in the woods.

The <b>Fighter</b> endures most of the melee combats and disposes of remarkable defense. He may also learn the leadership ability in time.

<b>Hunters</b> are a very versatile unit, very useful at nightime, but weak during day. His power will grow rapidly with time.

The <b>Scout</b> is great at exploring and quick diversions on the battlefield but misses the attack force. It is NOT a very wise choice for this campaign."
